Requirements:
* Make sure you have Xcode installed
* do ‘xcode-select install’ to install dependancies
* to check if installation is successful, do ‘xcode-select —-print-path’
  if a directory appears, you did correctly

* if that doesn’t work, just type in ‘gcc’ and a prompt to install will appear
* same thing goes for typing ‘make’
* You’re good to go!

HOW TO RUN THE GAME:

See that “build” folder?
Open it and go inside Release. The executable is there. 

Alternative: 
* Open up terminal
* Navigate to this directory
* Alternatively, you can just drag the folder named “Mazel” into terminal and
  do the command ‘cd ..’ without the single quotes
* type ‘make’ into terminal and wait for it to compile
* Game will automatically run
* If you want to keep the game, keep the executable produced

ENJOY!
